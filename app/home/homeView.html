                    Hello and welcome my site. I am a computer programmer who has just
                    graduated from the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT) from the Computer Systems Technology Diploma Program in the
                    Web and Mobile option.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My main focus during my studies was backend development and the exploration of RESTful
                    services and system management. This included development in PHP and ASP.NET where I developed WebApps and
                    RESTful API's using a number of frameworks. I also explored front-end development with Android, iOS and some
                    web development. I have become an avid fan of the Nodejs engine and Angularjs framework for its amazing power and
                    intricacy it adds to a typical website and the development process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally in my studies, I have worked with Java, C, and C++. One of my first projects I created on
                    my own was a Chess simulator that was developed in Java. This simple yet somewhat complicated project taught me alot about
                    inheritance and polymorphism. The project was large enough also to be an example of the value of code re-use and to develope with
                    code re-use in mind. With Java being the first language I was taught while attending BCIT, many of my coding 'best practices'
                    are based on standards enforced by this language and its developers. During my second and third semester at BCIT I used C
                    and C++ to make various console utilities including a grocery store simulator in C++ and a
                    number of file manipulating tools in C.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While at BCIT I was also accepted into Co-op for my program and had an 8 month internship at
                    <a href="http://cirius.com" class="visible-link">Cirius Secure Messaging</a> as a Quality Assurance Analyst. Periodically though
                    I had the opportunity to do some development on some internal tools. Along with learning C# from ASP.NET at BCIT, I
                    also gained valuable experience and learned a large amount about C# while at Cirius.
